<h2>THE MAN WHO WOULD.</h2>

<h3>III.&mdash;THE MAN WHO WOULD GET ON.</h3>

<p>"I dreamed," said the Scotch Professor, "that I was struggling
for dear life with a monstrous reptile, whose scaly coils wound about
my body, while the extremity of his own was lost in the distance.
At last I managed to shake myself free, and setting my foot on his
neck, I was preparing to cut his throat, when the animal looked up
at me with an appealing expression, and said, 'At least you might
give me a testimonial!'"</p>

<p>This professional nightmare (for the labours of a Scotch instructor
consist, to a great extent, in writing testimonials, or in evading requests
for them), suggested to one of his audience the history of
<span class="sc">Saunders McGregor</span>, the Man who would Get on. In boyhood,
<span class="sc">Saunders</span> obtained an exhibition, or bursary, to the University of
St. Mungo's. This success implied no high degree of scholarship, for
the benefice was only open to persons of the surname of <span class="sc">McGregor</span>,
and the Christian-name of <span class="sc">Saunders</span>. The provident parents of our
hero, having accidentally become aware of this circumstance, had their
offspring christened <span class="sc">Saunders</span>, and thus secured, from the very first,
an opening for the young man.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/253.png"><img width="100%" src="images/253.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>At St. Mungo's, <span class="sc">Saunders</span> was mainly notable for a generous view
of life, which enabled him to look on the goods of others as practically
common among Christians. A pipe of his own he somehow possessed,
but tobacco and lights he invariably borrowed, also golf-balls, postage-stamps,
railway fares, books, caps, gowns, and similar trifles; while his
nature was so social, that he invariably dropped in to supper with one or
other of his companions. The accident of being left alone for a few moments
in the study of our Examiner, where <span class="sc">Saunders</span> deftly possessed
himself of a set of examination-papers, enabled him to take his degree
with an ease and brilliance which very considerably astonished his
instructors. By adroitly using his good fortune, <span class="sc">Saunders</span> accumulated
a pile of most egregious testimonials, and these he regarded as the mainspring
of success in life. He had early discovered in himself a singular capacity for drawing
salaries, and as he had unbounded conceit and unqualified ignorance,
he conceived himself to be fit for any post in life to which a salary
is attached. He had also really great gifts as a <i>crampon</i>, or hanger-on,
and neglected no opportunity, while he made many, of securing
useful acquaintances. Thus it was the custom of his college to
elect, at stated periods, a man of eminence as Rector. <span class="sc">Saunders</span>
at once constituted himself secretary of a committee, and, without
consulting his associates, wrote invitations to eminent politicians,
poets, painters, actors, editors, clergymen, and other people much in
the public eye. In these effusions he poured forth the innocent
enthusiasm of his heart, expressing an admiration which might
seem excessive to all but its objects. They, with the guilelessness of
mature age and conscious merit, were touched by <span class="sc">Saunders's</span>
expressions of esteem, which they set down to hero-worship, and a
fervent study of Mr. <span class="sc">Carlyle's</span> works. Only one of the persons
addressed, unluckily, could be elected; but <span class="sc">Saunders</span> added their
responses to his pile of testimonials, and frequently gave them good
epistolary reason to remember his existence and his devotion.</p>

<p>His earliest object was to become secretary to somebody or something,
the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the
Society for the Protection of Aborigines, or Ancient Monuments, or
even as Secretary to the Carlton Club, <span class="sc">Saunders</span> felt he could do his
talents justice in any of these positions. If anything was to be had,
<span class="sc">Saunders</span> was the boy to ask for it; nay more, to ask other people to
ask. Private Secretaryships to Ministers, or societies, or great
Clubs, are not invariably given to the first applicant who comes
along, even if he appeals to testimonials in the Junior Mathematical
Class from Professor <span class="sc">McGlashan</span> of St. Mungo's. But
<span class="sc">Saunders</span> was not daunted. He would write to one notable, informing
him that his grandmother had been at a parish school with the
notable's great uncle&mdash;on which ground of acquaintanceship he
would ask that the notable should at once get him a post as Secretary
of a Geological Society, or as Inspector of Manufactories, or of
Salmon Fisheries, or to a Commission on the Trade of Knife-grinding.</p>

<p>Another notable he would tell that he had once been pointed out
to him in a railway station, therefore he was emboldened to ask
his correspondent to ask his Publisher, to get at the Editor of the
<i>Times</i>, and recommend him, <span class="sc">Saunders</span>, as Musical Critic, or Sub-editor,
or Society Reporter. Nor did <span class="sc">Saunders</span> neglect Professorships,
and vacant Chairs. His testimonials went in for all of them.
He was equally ready and qualified to be Professor of Greek, Metaphysics,
Etruscan, Chemistry, or the Use of the Globes, while
Biblical criticism and Natural Religion, prompted his wildest
yearnings. Though ignorant of foreign languages, he was prepared
to be a correspondent anywhere, and though he was purely unlearned
in all matters, he proposed to edit Dictionaries and Encyclopædias,
of course with the assistance of a large and competent staff. His
proofs of capacity for a series of occupations that would have
staggered a <span class="sc">Crichton</span>, was always attested by his old College
testimonials, for <span class="sc">Saunders</span> was of opinion that the courteous
<i>obiter dictum</i> of a Professor was an Open Sesame to all the golden
gates of the world. Meanwhile, he supported existence by teaching the
elements of the classic languages, with which he had the most distant
acquaintance, to little boys, at a Day School. But one of these pupils
came home, one afternoon, in tears, having been beaten on the palms
of the hands with a leathern strap, in addition to the task of writing out
the verb &tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&omega;. This punishment was inflicted because, in accordance
with <span class="sc">Saunders's</span> instructions, he had represented the Cyclops of Euripides
as "sweeping the stars with a rake." The original words of the Athenian
poet do not bear this remarkable construction, so <span class="sc">Saunders</span>
was dismissed from the only work which he
had ever made even a pretence of doing. He has not the
energy, nor the lungs necessary for the profession of an agitator; he
has not the grammar required in a penny-a-liner, he cannot cut
hair, and his manners unfit him for the occupation of a shop-assistant,
so that little is left open to <span class="sc">Saunders</span> but the industry of the
Blackmailer. The office of Secretary to a Missionary in a Leper
settlement, on an island of Tierra Del Fuego, is, however, vacant;
and, if the many important personages with whom <span class="sc">Saunders</span> has
corresponded will only make a united effort, it is possible that the
Man who would Get on may at last be got off, and relieve society
from the burden of his solicitations. May the comparative failure
in life of <span class="sc">Saunders McGregor</span> act as a warning to those who
think that they shall be heard, by men, for their much asking!</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;This does not apply to women. We have just been informed
that Mr. <span class="sc">Saunders McGregor</span>, M.A., is about to lead to the altar
the only and orphan daughter of the late <span class="sc">Alister McFungus</span>, Esq.,
of Castle Fungus, Dreepdaily, N.B., the eminent introducer of
remarkably improved processes in the manufacture of Heel-ball.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<span class="sc">One Down, t'other Come on</span>!"&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Horace Sedger</span> has a
<i>Prima Donna</i> supply always on tap. After two of them have retired
from the principal part in <i>Incognita</i>, the lively Miss <span class="sc">Aida
Jenoure</span>&mdash;("'Aid
'em <span class="sc">Jenoure</span>,' she ought to be called," quoth Mr. <span class="sc">Waggstaff</span>)&mdash;comes
to the rescue, and "on we goes again" with an excellent
<i>danseuse</i>, too, thoroughly in earnest, as her name implies, which
sounds like Miss Sin-cere and is written Miss <span class="sc">St. Cyr</span>.</p>

<h2>THE FIGHT FOR THE STANDARD.</h2>

<h4>(<i>Modern Monetary Version.</i>)</h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>'Twas the gallant Golden Knight downed his visor for the fight.</p>
<p class="i2">All true champions delight in hard tussles.</p>
<p>With his yellow Standard reared at his back, no foe he feared,</p>
<p class="i2">And his gaze all comers queered,</p>
<p class="i10">There at Brussels.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Like <i>Sir Kenneth</i>, only more so, he expanded his fine torso.</p>
<p class="i2">His Standard&mdash;bold he swore so&mdash;flying proudly,</p>
<p>Still supreme should flow and flaunt, its defenders none should daunt.</p>
<p class="i2">'Twas a very valiant vaunt.</p>
<p class="i10">Shouted loudly.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now the Silver Knight had sworn&mdash;that the Standard so long borne</p>
<p class="i2">By the Aureate One, in scorn irreducible</p>
<p>Should not solitary wave. He'd squabosh that champion brave,</p>
<p class="i2">Or would find a torrid grave&mdash;</p>
<p class="i10">In some crucible!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Such cremation he would dare if that Standard he might bear</p>
<p class="i2">To the dust, and upraise there one more Silvery.</p>
<p>For this Argent Knight, though pale, was right sure he could not fail,</p>
<p class="i2">He was proud of his white mail,</p>
<p class="i10">And his skill&mdash;very!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So here, Gentles, you behold that brave Knight in mail of Gold,</p>
<p class="i2">Sworn his Standard to uphold high and aureate;</p>
<p>And that blusterous battle-bout, twixt those champions stern and stout,</p>
<p class="i2">Will inspire, I have no doubt,</p>
<p class="i10">Our next Laureate!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Yank Knights-Errant may evince interest grave; that Indian Prince</p>
<p class="i2">Will alternate swell and wince as they struggle;</p>
<p>The young Scottish Knight <span class="sc">Balfour</span> (who looks callow more than dour)</p>
<p class="i2">Hopes the Silver Knight may score,</p>
<p class="i10">By some juggle.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But in spite of Yank and Scot, and the Bimetallic lot,</p>
<p class="i2">They who're fly to what is what, back the Gold 'un.</p>
<p>And did <i>I</i> bet&mdash;for fun&mdash;ere this Standard fight is done,</p>
<p class="i2">I should plank my ten to one</p>

<p class="i2">"Bright sunshine at Westminster&mdash;none,"</p>
<p class="i10">Yes, none!</p>

<h3>LADY GAY'S SELECTION.</h3>

<p class="author"><i>Mount Street, Berkeley Square.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch,</span></p>

<p>I am proud of being the "selection" referred to above,
though, as a matter of fact it was <i>I</i> who "selected" <span class="sc">Gay</span> from the
numerous sweet young things submitted for my approval during the
Season when I was considered "<i>the</i> parti"!&mdash;but on this point I
maintain a noble silence! In spite of the old Welsh proverb, "Oh,
wad some Gay the giftie gie us," &amp;c. &amp;c., I was a bit puzzled on
reading <span class="sc">Gay</span>'s letters, at the similarity of names, but thought it only
a coincidence, until she was so upset by the one she read when abroad,
that she confessed everything, and asked my advice!&mdash;It's very
strange how all these clever women, when they get into a fix, apply
for assistance to weak "<i>man</i>!" eh? Now that flat-racing is over,
we are "resting on our oars" for a time&mdash;(that is literally true, for
the country has been mostly under water lately!)&mdash;but we shall
shortly have a cut-in at steeplechasing, when <span class="sc">Gay</span> will doubtless
have some new experiences to relate; meanwhile, allow me to subscribe
myself&mdash;(I like to subscribe to everything good)&mdash;Yours explanatorily,</p>

<p class="author">(Lord) <span class="sc">Arthur Fleetwood</span>.</p>

<h2>THE "BEST EVIDENCE"&mdash;HOW NOT TO GET IT.</h2>

<p>Have been summoned to attend as a Witness in the trial of the six
roughs who first drugged and then savagely ill-treated a foolishly
convivial citizen in Whitechapel. Don't know if it was wise of me
to tell the Police that I could identify the men. Since my evidence
before the Magistrate came out, I have had thirty-seven threatening
letters, my front windows have been broken several times over, and
a valuable dog poisoned. Still, evidently a patriotic duty to "assist
the course of Justice;" and no doubt I shall be compensated.</p>

<p>So this is the "Central Criminal Court," is it? Should hardly
have believed it possible. Outside mean and dirty.</p>

<p>Interior, meaner and much dirtier. Speak to Usher. Usher most
polite. Glad, that at any rate, they <i>do</i> know how to treat important
Witnesses. Am assured I shall have a seat "close to the Judge."
Produce my witness-summons. Demeanour of Usher suddenly
changes. I shall have to go to the "Witnesses' Waiting-room in the
old Court." Where's that? <i>He</i> doesn't know. I'd better ask a
Policeman. It now flashes across me that Usher mistook me for a
wealthy, and probably generous spectator, and thought when I was
fumbling in my pocket for my summons, I was looking for half-a-crown
for <i>him</i>! Depressing.</p>

<p>Policeman leaves me in a dark, draughty passage, with a bench on
each side. "But where is the waiting-room?" I ask an attendant.
"<i>This</i> is the waiting-room," he replies. More like the Black Hole.
<i>Was</i> it wise of me to give information to the Police?</p>

<p><i>Two Days later.</i>&mdash;They crammed <i>forty</i> Witnesses into that passage!
No seats for half of them. We had one chair, and Usher took it
away "as a lady wanted it in Court." Lady no doubt a spectator&mdash;did
<i>she</i> hunt in her pocket for half-a-crown? Anyhow, after two
days in the passage, I have just given my evidence in Court, with
fearful cold on my lungs, owing to the draught. Very hoarse.
Ordered by Judge, sternly, to "speak up." Conscious that I looked
a wretched object. Jury regarded me with evident suspicion.
Severely cross-examined. Mentioned to Judge about my windows
being smashed, &amp;c.; could I receive anything for it? "Oh, dear
no," replied the Judge; "we never reward Witnesses." Amusement
in Court&mdash;at my expense. In fact, the course of Justice generally
seems to be altogether at my expense. Home in a cab and a fever.
Find ten more threatening letters, and an infernal machine under
area-steps. Go to bed. Doctor says I am in for pneumonia and
bronchitis, he thinks. Tells me I am thoroughly run down, and asks
me, "What I've been doing to reduce myself to this state?" I
reply that, "I have been assisting the course of Justice." Doctor
shrugs his shoulders, and I hear him distinctly mutter, "More fool
you!" I agree with Doctor, cordially. Am quite certain now that
it <i>was</i> unwise to tell Police that I could identify those criminals. If
this is the way in which Witnesses are treated, let Justice in future assist itself!</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>My Baronite has been reading <i>Mona Maclean, Medical Student</i>.
(<span class="sc">Blackwood</span>.) "It is," he tells me, "a Novel with a purpose&mdash;no
recommendation for a novel, more especially when the purpose
selected is that of demonstrating the indispensability of
women-doctors." Happily <span class="sc">Graham Travers</span>, as the author (being
evidently a woman) calls herself, is lured from her fell design.
There is a chapter or two of talk among the girls in the
dissecting-room and the chemical laboratory, with much about the
"spheno-maxillary fossa," the "dorsalis pedis," and the general whereabouts
of "Scarpa's triangle." But these can be skipped, and the
reader may get into the company of <i>Mona Maclean</i> when she is less
erudite, and more womanly. When not dissecting the "plantar arch,"
<i>Mona</i> is a bright, fearless, clever girl, with a breezy manner, refreshing
to all admitted to her company. The episode of her
shopkeeping experience is admirably told, and affords the author
abundant and varied opportunity of exercising her gift of drawing
character. <i>Mona Maclean</i> is, apparently, a first effort at novel-writing.
The workmanship improves up to the end of the third
volume; and Miss <span class="sc">Travers</span>' next book will be better still.</p>

<p>To Mr. <span class="sc">J. Fisher Unwin</span> comes the happy thought of issuing,
in a neatly-packed box, the whole twenty volumes of the Pseudonym
Library&mdash;and a very acceptable Christmas-Box it will make. The
volumes, with their odd, oblong shape, are delightful to hold; the
type is good, and the excellence of the literary matter is remarkably
well kept up over the already long series. Mr. <span class="sc">Unwin</span> promises
fresh volumes, introducing to the British public Finnish and Danish
authors, or Danish first, and the others to Finnish.</p>

<p>See how these Poets love one another! How touching is the

<h3>THE ROYAL ROAD TO COMFORT.&mdash;<span class="sc">A Dream</span>.</h3>

<p>The rival Steamboats were on the alert. It was a misty night,
and it was a difficult matter to make out the lights of Calais Harbour.</p>

<p>"We shall catch him yet," said the Captain of the Blue Vessel.</p>

<p>"He will not escape us," observed the C.O. of the Red.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Blue started at full steam ahead, and was lost to
sight in Calais harbour. She was quickly followed by the Red,
moving with equal expedition.</p>

<p>The vessels reached the quay nearly at the same time. Then there
was confusion and sounds of military music. Evidently the Illustrious
Personage had embarked. Then the mist cleared away.</p>

<p>"He is safe on board," said the Captain of the Blue Vessel, and
his Mate indulged in a short laugh of triumph.</p>

<p>"It does not matter," observed the Commanding Officer of the
Red; "the Blue may have his person, but <i>we</i> have his luggage!"</p>

<p>And then the cheers were renewed again and again, and the Illustrious
Personage came to the conclusion that English enterprise was
not without its disadvantages!</p>

<h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

<h3 class="sc">The Smoking-Room.</h3>

<h4>(<i>With which is incorporated "Anecdotes."</i>)</h4>

<p>Let us imagine, if you please, that the toils and trampings of the
day are over. You are staying at a comfortable country-house with
friends whom you like. You have had a good day at your host's
pheasants and his rabbits. Your shooting has been fairly accurate,
not ostentatiously brilliant, but on the whole satisfactory. You have
followed out the hints given in my previous Chapters, and are consequently
looked upon as a pleasant fellow, with plenty to say for himself. After tea, in the
drawing-room, you have had an hour or two for the writing of letters, which
you have of course not written, for the reading of the morning papers from
London which you have skimmed with a faint interest, and for the forty or
eighty or one hundred and twenty winks in an armchair in front of the fire,
which are by no means the least pleasant and comforting incident in the day's
programme. You have dressed for dinner in good time; you have tied your
white tie successfully "in once;" you have taken in a charming girl (<span class="sc">Rose
Larking</span>, let us say) to dinner. The dinner itself has been good, the drawing-room
interlude after dinner has been pleasantly varied with music, and the ladies
have, with the tact for which they are sometimes distinguished, retired early
to bed-rooms, where it is believed they spend hours in the combing of their
beautiful hair, and the interchange of gossip. You are in high spirits. You
think, indeed you are sure (and again, on thinking it well over, not quite so sure),
that the adorable <span class="sc">Rose</span> looked kindly upon you as she said good-night, and
allowed her pretty little hand to linger in your own while you assured her that
to-morrow you would get for her the pinion-feather of a woodcock, or die in the
attempt. You are now arrayed in your smoking-coat (the black with the
red silk-facings), and your velvet slippers with your initials worked in gold&mdash;a
birthday present from your sister. All the rest are, each after his own
fashion, similarly attired, and the whole male party
is gathered together in the smoking-room. There you sit and smoke
and chat until the witching hour of night, when everybody yawns
and grave men, as well as gay, go up to their beds.</p>

<p>Now, since you are an unassuming youngster, and anxious to learn,
you ask me probably, how you are to bear yourself in this important
assembly, what you are to speak about, and how? The chief thing,
I answer, is <i>not to be a bore</i>. It is so easy <i>not</i> to be a bore if only
you give a little thought to it. Nobody wants to be a bore. I cannot
imagine any man consciously incurring the execration of his fellow-men.
And yet there exist innumerable bores scattered through the
length and breadth of our happy country, and carrying on their
dismal business with an almost malignant persistency. Longwindedness,
pomposity, the exaggeration of petty trivialities, the irresistible
desire to magnify one's own wretched little achievements, to pose as
the little hero of insignificant adventures, and to relate them to the
whole world in every dull detail, regardless of the right of other men
to get an occasional word in edgewise&mdash;these are the true marks of
the genuine bore. He must know that you take no interest in him
or his story. Even if you did, his manner of telling it would flatten
you, yet he fascinates you with that glassy stare, that self-conscious
and self-admiring smirk, and distils his tale into your ears at the
very moment when you are burning to talk over old College-days
with <span class="sc">Chalmers</span>, or to discuss an article in the <i>Field</i> with
<span class="sc">Shabrack</span>.</p>

<p>I remember once finding myself, by some freak of mocking destiny,
in a house in which <i>two</i> bores had established fortified camps. On
the first night, we all became so dazed with intolerable dulness, that
our powers of resistance faded away to the vanishing point. Both bores
sallied out from their ramparts, laid our little possessions waste, and led,
each his tale of captives back with him, gagged, bound, and incapable of struggle.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>So next day, when the accustomed train</p>
<p>Of things grew round our sense again,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>we agreed together, those of us, I mean, who had suffered on the previous night,
that something must be done. What it was to be we could not at first decide.
We should have preferred "something lingering, with boiling oil in it," but at last
we decided on the brilliant suggestion of <span class="sc">Shabrack</span>,
who was of the party, that we should endeavour by some means or other to
bring the two bores, as it were, face to face in a kind of boring-competition in
the smoking-room that very night, to engage them in warfare against one another
and ourselves to sit by and watch them mutually extinguishing one
another; a result that, we were certain, could not fail to be brought about, owing
to the deadly nature of the weapons with which each was provided. Both the
bores, I may observe, shot execrably during the day. In the evening, after a
short preliminary skirmish, from which <span class="sc">Shabrack</span> the hussar extricated us with
but little loss, that which we desired came to pass. It was a terrible spectacle.
In a moment both these magnificent animals, their bristles erect, and all their
tusks flashing fiercely in the lamp-light, were locked in the death-grapple. Every
detail of the memorable struggle is indelibly burnt
into my brain. Even at this distance of time, I can remember
how we all looked on, silent, awestruck, fascinated, as the dreadful
fight proceeded to its inevitable close. For the benefit of others, let
me attempt to describe it in the appropriate language of the Ring.</p>

<h3 class="sc">Great Fight Between the Kentish Proser and the Hampshire Dullard.</h3>

<p><i>Round I.</i>&mdash;Both men advanced, confident, but cautious. After
sparring for an opening, the Proser landed lightly on the jaw
with,&mdash;"When the Duke of <span class="sc">Dashbury</span> did me the honour to ask
me to his Grace's noble deer-forest." He ducked to avoid the
return, but the Hampshire Champion would not be denied, and
placed two heavy fish-stories fair in the bread-basket. The Proser
swung round a vicious right-hander anecdote about a stag shot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span>
at 250 yards, but the blow fell short, and he
was fairly staggered by two in succession
("the tree-climbing rabbit," and "the Marquis
of <span class="sc">Dullfield's</span> gaiters"), delivered
straight on the mouth. First blood for the
Dullard. After some hard exchanges they
closed, and fell, the Dullard underneath.</p>

<p><i>Round II.</i>&mdash;Both blowing a good deal.
The Proser put up his Dukes, and let fly
with both of them, one after another, at the
Dullard's conk, drawing claret profusely.
Nothing daunted, the Dullard watched his
opportunity, and delivered a first-class Royal
Prince on the Proser's right eye, half closing
that optic. The men now closed, but broke
away again almost directly. Some smart
fibbing, in which neither could claim an
advantage, ensued. The round was brought
to a close by some rapid exchanges, after
which the Proser went down. Betting 6 to 4 on the Dullard.</p>

<p><i>Round III., and last.</i>&mdash;Proser's right
peeper badly swollen, the Dullard gory, and
a bit groggy, but still smiling. Proser opened
with a ricochet, which did great execution,
but was countered heavily when he attempted
to repeat the trick, the Dullard all
but knocking him off his legs with a fifty-pound
salmon. After some slight exchanges
they began a hammer-and-tongs game, in
which Proser scored heavily. Dullard, however,
pulled himself together for a final rush.
They met in the middle of the ring, and
both fell heavily. As neither was able to
rise, the fight was drawn. Both men were
heavily damaged, and were carried away with their jaws broken.</p>

<p>There you have the story. The actual
result was that these two ponderous bores all
but did one another to death. So exhausted
were they by the terrible conflict, that our
comfort was not again disturbed by them
during this particular visit. We were lucky,
though at first we scarcely saw it, in getting
two evenly matched ironclad bores together.
If we had had only one, the matter would have been far more difficult.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Interior of a Palace.</i> Emperor <i>and</i>
Empress <i>discovered discussing the former's tour in foreign parts.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<div class="drama">
<p><i>Emperor</i> (<i>finishing a good story</i>). So after
I had made a hearty meal off the bread-and-milk,
I gave the old woman a note for five
thousand thalers, and told her to buy a three-sous
portrait of myself so that she might see
the Sovereign that she had saved from starvation. Ha! ha! ha! Wasn't it amusing?</p>

<p><i>Empress</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Very, dear; but wasn't
it a little expensive? Surely you could have
got the bread-and-milk for a smaller sum?</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> Of course I could! But then,
don't you see, it made me popular. It's in
all the papers, and reads splendidly!</p>

<p><i>Empress.</i> Yes, of course, dear. By the
way, I found this volume (<i>producing book
bound in velvet with real gold clasps</i>) in your overcoat. May I peep into it?</p>

<p><i>Emperor</i> (<i>doubtfully</i>). I don't think you
will find it particularly interesting. I have
just jotted down my petty cash disbursements.</p>

<p><i>Empress</i> (<i>opening book and glancing at contents</i>).
Dear me! Why the total amounts to
£15,000! I see it's put in English money.</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> Yes, it saves trouble. When
I am travelling I get rather confused with
all coinage save that of Mother's Fatherland.</p>

<p><i>Empress.</i> But surely £15,000 is a lot to expend upon extras?</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> Depends on the view you take of
things. I had a lot of things to buy.</p>

<p><i>Empress.</i> But surely <i>this</i> must be wrong? Shoeblack fifty guineas!</p>

<p><i>Emperor</i> (<i>lightly</i>). No, I think that's all
right. You see, the fellow, after he had
cleaned my boots, suddenly recognised me,
called me Sire, and sang the "<i>Wacht am
Rhein</i>." I couldn't, after that, give him less.</p>

<p><i>Empress.</i> Well, you know best, dear; but
I should have thought you could have got
your boots cleaned for rather less!</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> Possibly; but I should have lost
the story. And you know it reads so well.</p>

<p><i>Empress.</i> And here's another rather big item. £800 for a London cabman!</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> I consider <i>that</i> the cheapest item in the lot. He wanted more!</p>

<p><i>Empress.</i> And here are several items of
seventy pounds apiece. What were <i>they</i> for?</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> Oh, nothing in particular. Little
girl picked up my handkerchief, and a little
boy asked me for a kite. Was obliged to give
them each a bundle of tenners. It would have
been so mean if I had given them less. But
there, I told you you wouldn't find the book
at all interesting. If you will pass it to me, I will lock it up.</p>

<p><i>Empress.</i> Oh, certainly, dear. (<i>Gives up
volume.</i>) And now, darling, I am going to
ask you a favour. You never saw such a pet
of a coronet as they have at Von &mdash;&mdash;'s.
Now I want you to buy it for me particularly.</p>

<p><i>Emperor</i> (<i>embarrassed</i>). Certainly, dear&mdash;but
you know, we are not too well off.</p>

<p><i>Empress.</i> Oh, but it is simply charming.
Rubies round the edge, and a cross of brilliants
and emeralds. And, really, <i>so</i> cheap. They only want £100,000 for it!</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> Very nice indeed; but just at
this moment it would be a little inconvenient to produce so large a sum.</p>

<p><i>Empress.</i> Large sum! Why, the rubies alone are worth all the money.</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> Yes, I know, dear. And now I
must hurry away; duty, my love, comes before pleasure. See you soon.</p>

<h2>AN EVENING FROM HOME.</h2>

<p>There used to appear daily&mdash;and it may be appearing daily now,
for aught I know, only, speaking on oath, I haven't lately noticed
it&mdash;a question addressed by Everybody in General, or by Nobody in Particular
to Everybody Else, which took this form: "Where shall we dine to-day?" I forget what
the answer was, but, as a rule, the domesticated man, with a good cook
in his own kitchen, could answer it offhand by saying to himself,
"'<i>Where</i> shall we dine to-day?' Why, at home, of course&mdash;where
better?&mdash;and catch me moving out afterwards." But, if he were contemplating
the unpleasant
certainty of having post-prandially to leave his hearth and home in order
to visit some theatre, opera, or concert, then it might occur to him that
he could do the thing well, and give his party a novel treat, if, in French
fashion, he took them somewhere to dine, previous to doing their play.
Thus it occurred to Yours
truly, <span class="sc">Y Ti-Bullus Bibulus</span>, a day or two ago, when, dressed in his
classical evening Togaryii in a <i>Currus Pulcher</i> (with
a <i>Cursor</i> alongside anticipating <i>denarii</i>, and risking
the sharp rebuke of a probable <i>Cursor</i> inside the vehicle) he was passing
the Oxford Music
Hall, and a brightly decorated Restauration caught his observant
eye. Was it new, or was it a Restauration restored? Its name, in
large letters, "<span class="sc">Frascati</span>." This seemed at once to lend itself to a
familiar jingle, and I found myself humming,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, did you never hear of Frascati?</p>
<p>'Tis not far from Rome, eh my hearty?</p>
<p class="i2">The place looks so fine,</p>
<p class="i2">I will there go and dine,</p>
<p>And I'll bring with me all of my party!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/264-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/264-1.png" alt="'Our Hamp-phitryon.'" /></a>"Our Hamp-phitryon."</div>

<p>Horatian inspiration! I like to find out a new dining-place.
Years ago, by the merest accident sailing north, I discovered the
Holborn, and, since then, how many have not blessed the Columbus
Holbornius? I do not ask how many <i>have</i> done so. "That
is another story." Since then, the taste for dining domestically
away from home has come considerably into fashion. The Ladies
like it, and the Law allows it. (Quotation from <i>Merchant of Venice</i>
adapted to occasion&mdash;Restaurant edition&mdash;<i>Portia</i> for two.) It is a
cheerful change, it assists the circulation of coin, it is an aid to the
solution of the problems of Bimetallism, it rejuvenesces the home-fire-sider,
it developes ideas, restores the balance of temper; and, if
only the dinner be good, everybody goes away delighted,&mdash;guests are
satisfied, the host is pleased, the waiter smiles on the tipper, the
tipper on the manager, the manager on the proprietor, and all is Joy
and Junketing! Judge my surprise, when to me, <span class="sc">Tibullus</span>, entering
Frascati, and as <i>Cicerone</i>, informing my friends (all eager and hungry,
and therefore unwilling to dispute) how Frascati was the ancient
Tusculum, a well-known face appears welcoming us with smiles.
It is Signor <span class="sc">Hampi</span>, better known as Mr. <span class="sc">Hamp</span> of Holborn.
"Salve!" quoth I, as <span class="sc">Tibullus</span>. "The same to you, Sir," responds
<span class="sc">Hampius</span>. "Now," said my friend <span class="sc">Wagstaffius</span>, without whom
no party is complete, "Now we shall be Hamp-ly satisfied."</p>

<p>The arrangement of the Frascati is a novelty; it is all so open and,
though there are plenty of staffers about, not in the least stuffy. It
would take a considerable crowd to overcrowd the place and to demoralise
the troops of well-disciplined waiters, all under the eye of
the ever-vigilant generalissimo of the forces, who in his white waist-coat,
black tie, and frock-coat of most decided cut and uncompromising
character&mdash;there is much in a frock-coat and something too in
the wearing of it&mdash;is here, there, and everywhere, and only waiting
till the last moment, and the right one, when the banquet is ended, to
give the word of command, "Charge!"&mdash;and the charge (decidedly
moderate and previously named in the <i>carte du jour</i>) is received
with satisfaction and defrayed with delight.</p>

<p>I have only one suggestion to make, and that affects the music not
the meal. Let the music be adapted to the dishes; and not only
should the course of time be considered as it progresses, but also
the time of the course. For example,&mdash;who that has an ear for music
can swallow oysters deliberately and sedately while the band is
playing a mad galop? Let there be something very slow and
<i>pianissimo</i> for the <i>hors d'&oelig;uvres</i>: something gentle and soothing
for the oysters; there can be an indication of heartiness in the
melody that ushers in the soup, as though giving it a warm welcome.
There should be a mincing minuet-like movement for the
<i>entrées</i>, a sparkling air for the champagne, and something robust for
the joint. A sporting tune for the game: sweet melody for the
sweets, and a grand and grateful Chorale&mdash;a kind of thanksgiving
service as it were&mdash;when the last crumb and the last bit of cheese
have been swept away.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:32%;"><a href="images/264-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/264-2.png" alt="'Up I came with my little lot!!'" /></a>"Up I came with my little lot!!"</div>

<p>After this to The Pavilion, in plenty of time to hear the ubiquitous
<span class="sc">Albert Chevalier</span> singing his celebrated coster-songs. Signor
<span class="sc">Costa</span> was a well-known name in the musical world some years ago;
<span class="sc">Chevalier</span> Coster is about the best-known now. These ditties are
uncommonly telling; the music is so catching and so really good.
Then his singing of the little Nipper "on'y so 'igh, that's all," has
in it that touch of nature which makes you drop the silent tear and
pretend you are blowing your nose. Capital entertainment at the
"Pav." Ingress and egress is not difficult, and the place doesn't
become inconveniently hot. The sweet singer with the poetic name
of <span class="sc">Herbert Campbell</span> is very funny; which indeed he would be,
even if he never opened his mouth. Such a low comedian's "mug!"</p>

<p>But of all the pretty things to be seen in its perfection here (I
have seen it elsewhere, and was not so struck by it) is the Skirt
Dance. It is "real elegant," graceful, and picturesque. What a change has come over
the Music-hall entertainment since&mdash;since&mdash;"since even <i>I</i> was a
boy!" says the Acting Manager, Mr. <span class="sc">Edward Swanborough</span>,&mdash;evergreen
in the true sense of the word. A vast improvement, no doubt of it. But, with such
good amusement for the public, why on earth do the Music-Halls want to do
"Dramatic Sketches"? And, if they do them, then, judging by what I saw at the "Pav," I
am fain to ask again, why, in the name of <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>, and the
musical glasses, should the theatres object?</p>

<p>Does anyone seriously think that <i>Othello</i> or <i>King Lear</i>
is wanted at the Music-Halls, or that <span class="sc">Sheridan's</span> <i>School for Scandal</i>
wouldn't empty any Music-Hall of its patrons? It is the "variety" which is
the charm of the Music-hall show, and if any one part of the variety show is a bit
too long&mdash;longer let us say, than the time it takes to smoke one-eighth
of a fair-sized cigar and to drink half
a glass of something according to taste&mdash;then the audience will pretty
plainly express what <i>they</i> understand by Variety, what <i>they</i> have
paid to see, and what they mean to have for their money; and if they
don't get it there, they'll go somewhere else where it will be given
them. The summing-up, Gentlemen, is that, if you want a pleasant
evening, you can't do better than dine at Frascati and afterwards
patronise the "Pav." Such is the opinion of</p>

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
